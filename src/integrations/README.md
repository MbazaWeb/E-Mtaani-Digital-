# Integrations

This folder holds all external government/service integrations for Mtaani Kiganjani.
Government/external integrations ship **disabled**. Disabled NIDA, TRA, Police
and SMS integrations fail clearly instead of manufacturing successful results.
Payments are the temporary exception: an explicitly labelled simulation remains
available until a real provider is connected.

## How it works

```
src/integrations/
├── config.ts        ← feature flags (one switch per integration)
├── types.ts         ← shared result/data types
├── index.ts         ← barrel export: import { verifyNida, ... } from "@/integrations"
├── nida/            ← National ID verification
├── tra/             ← Tanzania Revenue Authority (tax)
├── police/          ← Tanzania Police Force (fines, clearance)
├── payments/        ← GePG / mobile money / bank
└── sms/             ← transactional SMS
```

Each integration exposes a single public function. Real integrations route only
when explicitly enabled; otherwise unavailable integrations return a disabled error:

```ts
import { verifyNida } from "@/integrations";

const result = await verifyNida("1988...0129");
if (result.ok) {
  // result.data.verified, result.source === "live"
}
```

## Turning an integration on

1. **Get access** — sign the agreement / register with the provider and obtain
   credentials. (These are access/authorization steps, not code.)
2. **Add env vars** (Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables). Keep
   secrets server-side; only `VITE_ENABLE_*`, base URLs, and non-secret IDs are
   safe in the client bundle.
3. **Flip the flag** — set `VITE_ENABLE_<NAME>=true`.
4. **Implement the `...Live()` function** in that integration's `index.ts`.
   For anything with a secret key (NIDA, TRA, Police, payments, SMS), call a
   **server-side route** (Supabase Edge Function or serverless `/api/...`) from
   the `Live()` function — never put the secret in the browser.

## Recommended sequence

| Order | Integration         | Why first                                                 |
| ----- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | **Payments (GePG)** | Unlocks the most value; lets the portal collect real fees |
| 2     | **SMS**             | Cheap, high-impact; notify citizens of status changes     |
| 3     | **NIDA**            | Makes identity verification real (raises document trust)  |
| 4     | **TRA / Police**    | Inter-agency data; enables the obligations/fines features |

# Secrets — DO NOT put in client. Store as server-side env in your
# Supabase Edge Functions / serverless routes only.

# SMS_API_KEY=...
```

## Demonstration mode

Application demo behavior is opt-in with `VITE_DEMO_MODE=true`. Production must
use `VITE_DEMO_MODE=false` and must not fall back to fake operational records
because a network/backend dependency is unavailable. Payment simulation remains
separately labelled and non-authoritative.
