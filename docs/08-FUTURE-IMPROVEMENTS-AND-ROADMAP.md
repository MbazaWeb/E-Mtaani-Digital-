## Phase 2 — Production Hardening (Next 3 Months)

### Payment Integration

- **Mobile Money API integration**: Live M-Pesa (Vodacom), TigoPesa (Tigo), and Airtel Money via their merchant APIs
- **GePG integration**: Tanzania's Government Electronic Payment Gateway for official fee collection
- **Payment reconciliation**: Automated matching of mobile money transactions to applications
- **Receipt generation**: Official TRA-compliant payment receipts

### NIDA Integration

- **Live NIDA API**: Query the National Identification Authority database to auto-fill citizen profiles from their NIDA number
- **Biometric verification**: Fingerprint or face match against NIDA records (requires NIDA API partnership)
- **Real-time verification badges**: Green checkmark for NIDA-verified citizens

### File Storage Migration

- **Supabase Storage buckets**: Move document uploads from base64-in-database to dedicated object storage
- **Benefits**: Reduced database size, faster queries, direct image URLs, CDN caching
- **Image compression**: Auto-resize uploaded photos to reduce storage costs

### SMS Notifications

- **Twilio / Africa's Talking integration**: SMS alerts for application status changes
- **Critical for Tanzania**: Many citizens lack reliable email but have active mobile numbers
- **Templates**: "Maombi yako #TZ-MKZ-20260604 yameidhinishwa. Pakua cheti kwenye mtaani.go.tz"

---

## Phase 3 — Progressive Web App & Offline Support (3–6 Months)

### Progressive Web App (PWA)

- **Install on homescreen**: Citizens tap "Add to Home Screen" on Android/iOS — the app launches like a native application with a splash screen and the Mtaani Kiganjani icon, no app store needed
- **Service Worker**: Caches the application shell (HTML, CSS, JS, icons) so the app opens instantly even without internet
- **Offline pages**: Dashboard, profile, and form pages load from cache when offline — critical for rural Tanzania where connectivity is intermittent
- **Push notifications**: Real-time alerts for application status changes without SMS costs (requires HTTPS + service worker)
- **Web App Manifest**: Defines app name ("Mtaani Kiganjani"), theme color (emerald), orientation, and display mode (standalone)

### Background Sync for Forms

- **Auto-save on every field change**: Form progress saved to IndexedDB/localStorage after each input — citizens never lose work if the browser crashes or they accidentally close the tab
- **Offline queue**: When a citizen submits a form without internet, it enters a local queue with a "Pending Sync" badge
- **Automatic retry**: When connectivity returns, the Service Worker detects the network change and submits all queued applications in order
- **Conflict resolution**: If the same form is submitted from two devices, the server keeps the newest submission and notifies the citizen
- **Sync status indicator**: A small icon in the header shows: ● Green (online, synced) / ● Amber (online, syncing) / ● Red (offline, queued)

### Inter-Ward Transfer Workflow

- **Citizen relocation**: When a citizen moves from one ward to another, they initiate a transfer request from their profile
- **Current ward release**: The citizen's current ward officer reviews and approves the release, confirming the citizen's record is clean
- **New ward acceptance**: The destination ward officer receives the transfer request and accepts the citizen into their jurisdiction
- **Record migration**: All historical applications, documents, and verification status transfer with the citizen — no re-verification needed
- **Transfer certificate**: An official "Certificate of Transfer" PDF is generated with QR verification, signed by both ward officers
- **Timeline tracking**: Full audit trail: Requested → Released → Accepted → Completed

---

## Phase 4 — Analytics, Reporting & Document Verification (6–9 Months)

### Service Delivery Analytics Dashboard

- **Processing time metrics**: Average time from submission to approval per service type, per ward, per month — identifies bottlenecks (e.g., "Burial permits take 4.2 days average in Ilala but 1.1 days in Kinondoni")
- **Approval rate tracking**: Percentage of applications approved vs. rejected vs. returned, broken down by service and officer — surfaces training needs
- **Staff performance**: Applications processed per officer, average review time, citizen satisfaction scores
- **Trend analysis**: Month-over-month growth in registrations, service usage, and revenue with interactive charts (Recharts)
- **Peak hours heatmap**: When citizens submit applications — helps with staffing decisions

### Revenue & Financial Dashboards

- **Fee collection by ward**: Total revenue per ward office, filterable by date range
- **Service type breakdown**: Which services generate the most revenue (pie chart + table)
- **Payment method distribution**: M-Pesa vs. TigoPesa vs. Airtel vs. Bank — informs payment provider negotiations
- **Outstanding fees**: Applications approved but not yet paid — follow-up action queue
- **Monthly/quarterly/annual summaries**: Auto-generated financial reports for government oversight
- **Budget vs. actual**: Compare expected fee collection against actual collected amounts

### Citizen Satisfaction & Feedback

- **Post-service rating**: After downloading a certificate, citizens rate the experience (1–5 stars) with optional comment
- **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**: "Would you recommend this service to others?" — tracked over time
- **Complaint tracking**: Citizens can flag issues directly from their application detail page
- **Feedback dashboard**: Admin sees aggregated ratings per service, per ward, with trend lines
- **Automated follow-up**: Low-rated experiences trigger a notification to the ward supervisor

### Export to Excel/PDF Reports

- **One-click Excel export**: Any dashboard table exportable to `.xlsx` with formatted headers, filters, and totals
- **PDF report generation**: Formal government reports with letterhead, charts, tables, and signatures — ready for printing
- **Scheduled reports**: Admin configures weekly/monthly auto-generated reports delivered via email
- **Custom date ranges**: All reports filterable by start date, end date, region, district, service type
- **Government format compliance**: Reports formatted per Tanzania public sector reporting standards

### Document Verification Portal (Public)

- **Public QR scanner page**: A standalone page at `/verify` accessible without login — any institution (bank, employer, school, police) can scan or enter a certificate's QR code to verify authenticity
- **Verification display**: Shows document type, holder name, issue date, issuing officer, and ward — with a clear "AUTHENTIC ✓" or "NOT FOUND ✗" result
- **Verification API (REST)**: `GET /api/verify?ref=TZ-MKZ-20260604-5380` returns JSON with document status — allows automated verification by third-party systems (banks, employers, courts)
- **Rate limiting**: Prevent abuse with IP-based rate limiting (100 verifications/hour per IP)
- **Tamper detection**: Each document's content (applicant name, dates, service type) is hashed at generation time; the verification endpoint re-computes the hash and compares — any tampering (altered PDF) is detected and flagged
- **Verification log**: Every verification attempt is logged (who verified, when, from where) for audit purposes
- **Offline verification**: The QR code encodes enough data (name, reference, hash) for basic verification even without internet — the scanner app checks the hash locally

## Phase 5 — Government Department Integration (9–15 Months)

### Government Department Portal

A major platform expansion that connects ward-level services to **national government departments** (Police, Health, Legal/Courts, Education, Social Welfare, Immigration, etc.), enabling cross-departmental workflows, escalation, and inter-agency communication.

#### Department Management (Admin)

| Feature                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Create departments**             | Admin defines government departments (e.g., Tanzania Police Force, Ministry of Health, Judiciary, RITA, Immigration) with name, code, level (national/regional/district), and contact details |
| **Department roles & permissions** | Each department gets its own role type with configurable capabilities — what they can view, what actions they can take, what data they access                                                 |
| **Department staff creation**      | Like creating ward staff, but scoped to a department — admin creates department users with department-specific dashboards                                                                     |
| **Department hierarchy**           | National HQ → Regional offices → District offices — mirrors Tanzania's government structure                                                                                                   |
| **Service routing rules**          | Admin configures which services automatically route copies to which departments (e.g., "All dispute resolutions → Legal Department", "All burial permits → Health Department")                |

#### Department Portal (Per-Department Dashboard)

Each department gets its own portal with a tailored interface:

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Core features per department portal**:

1. **Dashboard**: Escalation counts, response metrics, pending actions, resolution rates
2. **Escalation Requests**: Incoming requests from ward staff — viewable, actionable, with response workflow
3. **Court Registry** (Legal/Judiciary): Case filing, hearing schedules, verdict records, bail processing
4. **Application Copies**: Auto-forwarded copies of relevant applications from ward level (read-only unless action required)
5. **Department-in-District/Regional**: Each department's portal filters to their geographic jurisdiction
6. **Inter-department referral**: Department A can forward a case to Department B (e.g., Police → Judiciary)

#### Staff Escalation Workflow

Ward staff gain the ability to **escalate applications to government departments**:

```
Staff reviewing         Staff clicks           Department receives       Department
an application    →    "Escalate" button   →   escalation notification  →  takes action
                       Selects department       with full application
                       Adds note/reason         context and attachments
```

**How it works**:

1. Ward staff opens an application (e.g., a land dispute that requires police involvement)
2. Staff clicks **"Escalate to Department"** button on the review panel
3. A dropdown shows **available departments** (only those the admin has created and activated)
4. Staff selects the department (e.g., "Tanzania Police Force — Ilala District")
5. Staff adds an **escalation note** explaining why the department's involvement is needed
6. The system creates an **escalation record** linked to the original application
7. The department's portal shows the escalation with full context (application data, uploaded documents, citizen info, staff notes)
8. The department can: **Accept** (take ownership), **Respond** (provide guidance back to ward staff), or **Refer** (forward to another department)
9. The citizen sees "Escalated to Police Department" in their application timeline
10. Resolution flows back: department marks resolved → ward staff completes the application

**Use cases**:

| Scenario                         | Ward Action                                     | Department      | Department Action                     |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Land dispute turns violent       | Escalate dispute application                    | Police          | Investigation, incident report        |
| Citizen needs bail letter        | Submit Barua ya Utambulisho addressed to police | Police          | Receive letter, process bail          |
| Dispute requires court hearing   | Escalate dispute                                | Judiciary       | Register case, schedule hearing       |
| Burial permit — unnatural death  | Escalate burial application                     | Health / Police | Death investigation, medical examiner |
| Construction near protected area | Escalate construction permit                    | Environment     | Environmental impact assessment       |
| Business fraud complaint         | Escalate dispute                                | Legal / BRELA   | Investigation, regulatory action      |
| Child welfare concern            | Escalate from staff observation                 | Social Welfare  | Case worker assignment                |
